        flexibility around changing your trip.
      </h2>

      <p>
        We want to make sure that when you book with us, you feel secure in the
        knowledge that you can change your date, change your trek and also your
        payment options at ANY time which is why we have this Flexibility
        promise.
      </p>
      <p>
        Here at EverTrek we understand more than most the need for flexibility
        when booking your trip. If an unexpected life change has occurred such
        as a new baby, injuries or indeed a pandemic (let's hope we never
        experience that one again!) - we want to make sure you have the
        flexibility to make date changes to your trip without the extra admin
        fees or hassle.
      </p>
      <p>
        Under our flexibility promise you can usually change the date of your
        trip up to 30 Days before you are due to leave without any admin fees or
        bother - as many times as you like!*
      </p>
      <p>
        Don't know a date you want to reschedule onto?! It's all gravy - we can
        put your trip on hold for up to 6 months so you can pick your dates when
        you know more.
      </p>
      <p>
        We have rescheduled literally 100's of our EverTrekkers trips to future
        dates and even onto different treks altogether over the last couple of
        years without any extra fees or charges.
      </p>
      <p>
        We know it's your goal to get on a trip as soon as you can so we always
        want to remain as flexible as possible.
      </p>
      <p>As with everything there are a couple conditions to be aware of...</p>
      <p>
        - *For the majority of our trips you usually won't incur any other
        additional charges, however it's important to note that in South America
        we will have had to pay out for permits and non-cancellable internal
        travel that may need to be covered. This will usually be up to the
        amount of $300 maximum but we'll certainly keep this as low as possible
        and only charge you for the exact amount that is incurred.
      </p>
      <p>
        -Trips that have a minimum number requirement will only be able to be
        amended up to 6 months before the trip date.
      </p>
      <p>
        - If you have booked onto a trek under an old price point that we no
        longer offer due to our own internal increases, you will be offered one
        reschedule honoured under that price point - following this you will
        need to reschedule under our updated price point and will be required to
        pay the difference.
      </p>
      <p>
        - It's important to note that our refund terms apply from your original
        trip date not your rescheduled trip date.
      </p>
